# COMS4167-Tester

A Python script to run the test cases for the COMS4167 - Computer Animation assignments in Codio. 

## Usage 

In order to run the program you need to specify which assignment you are working on. For example:

`python3 run_tests.py t3m2`

### Optional Arguments

**--omit** or **-o**: Specific files and/or directories you want to omit from testing.
